# Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in adults. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of retinal images containing both healthy and DR-affected eyes. The dataset is not provided with this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, similar datasets can be obtained from sources such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection) or medical research institutions.

## Model Architecture
The convolutional neural network (CNN) model architecture used for this project consists of multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations followed by fully connected layers. The model is designed to classify retinal images into different severity levels of diabetic retinopathy.

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**: Use the provided script `train_model.py` to train the model on your dataset. Update the dataset directory path and parameters according to your setup before running the script.
   
2. **Classifying Images**: After training the model, use the script `classify_image.py` to classify new retinal images. Provide the path to the image you want to classify as input to the script.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL)

Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pillow
```
